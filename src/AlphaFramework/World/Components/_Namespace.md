summary: Component system for describing rendering aspects, collision bodies, gameplay behavior, etc..
---
AlphaFramework's component system allows you to describe various aspects of game entities in an engine-agnostic way. Components define how entities should be rendered, how they interact physically, and what gameplay behavior they exhibit, without depending on the rendering engine.

For building reusable entities from components, see <xref:AlphaFramework.World.Templates>.
